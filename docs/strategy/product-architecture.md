## 0. The frame

CaliLean ships **15 SKUs across 6 categories**. The lineup is larger than the original 8-SKU plan because the proof market validated demand across more pathways than anticipated. Every SKU still passes the same three filters: brand fit, literature density, and story clarity.

Posture is **research-use-only** (per [SKA-2](/SKA/issues/SKA-2)). All copy is research-context. No therapeutic claims. No "what it does for you."

## 2. The launch lineup (15 SKUs)

### Recovery (4)

### Metabolic / Weight Management (3) — CL- Series

> **Compliance note:** These compounds use the CL- naming convention on all public-facing surfaces. The CL- prefix is a proprietary product identifier. Generic drug names appear only in metadata `synonyms` fields and internal documentation, never in storefront titles, subtitles, or marketing copy.

| # | SKU | Handle | Receptor profile | Story | Variants |

| 7 | **CL-3R** | `cl-3r` | GIP/GLP-1R/GcgR triple agonist | The most mechanistically expansive metabolic research tool — three receptors, one compound. Extended COA panel (LC-MS identity confirmation). | 10mg, 20mg, 30mg |

### Growth & Anti-Aging / GH Axis (2)

| 9 | **Tesamorelin** (TH-9507) | `tesamorelin` | Synthetic GHRH analog for metabolic regulation and cellular signaling research. | 10mg, 20mg |

### Longevity (2)

| # | SKU | Handle | Story | Variants |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | **MOTS-c** | `mots-c` | Mitochondrial-derived peptide studied in AMPK signaling and metabolic homeostasis. The deep-cut that signals we read papers. | 10mg, 40mg |
| 11 | **SS-31** (Elamipretide) | `ss-31` | Mitochondria-targeted tetrapeptide for oxidative stress and cardiolipin interaction studies. | 10mg, 50mg |

### Specialty / Cosmetic (3)

| # | SKU | Handle | Story | Variants |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 12 | **GLOW** | `glow` | Research blend: GHK-Cu (50mg) + TB-500 (10mg) + BPC-157 (10mg). Collagen signaling and tissue remodeling. | 70mg |
| 13 | **KLOW** | `klow` | Research blend: GHK-Cu + TB-500 + BPC-157 + KPV. Collagen signaling + inflammation research. | 80mg |
| 14 | **Melanotan 2** | `melanotan-ii` | Melanocortin-receptor agonist for melanin-stimulation research. | 10mg |

## 3. CL- naming rationale

The metabolic compounds (formerly referenced by their generic pharmaceutical names) use proprietary CL- identifiers on all public-facing surfaces:

| CL Code | Receptor profile | Internal reference |
|---|---|---|
| CL-1S | Single (GLP-1R) | See metadata synonyms |
| CL-2T | Two receptors (GIP + GLP-1R) | See metadata synonyms |
| CL-3R | Three receptors (GIP + GLP-1R + GcgR) | See metadata synonyms |

**Why:** Regulatory compliance. Generic drug names on a storefront invite scrutiny from platforms and agencies. The CL- system communicates receptor count to informed researchers without triggering automated compliance flags. The naming convention is: `CL-[number of receptors][first letter of distinguishing feature]`.

---

## 4. Naming and labeling rules

1. **Generic / chemical name first, brand-friendly framing in the subtitle.** Exception: CL- series uses proprietary codes as titles.
2. **Blends are named for the use case, not the molecules.** Right: `Wolverine`. Wrong: `BPC-157 / TB-500 Blend`. Molecules go in description and COA.
3. **No mg in the title.** Mg goes in the variant selector. Title is the compound, variant is the dose.
4. **No therapeutic claims in titles or subtitles.** Subtitles describe the receptor profile or research application.
5. **CAS number, molecular weight, and PubChem ID render on the PDP** (in metadata).
6. **CL- series: never use generic drug names in any customer-facing copy.** Internal docs may reference them for clarity.

## 5. Pricing direction

### 5.1 Current pricing (v3)

| SKU | Variant(s) | Price |
|---|---|---|
| BPC-157 | 5mg, 10mg | TBD (placeholder $1) |
| TB-500 | 5mg, 10mg | TBD (placeholder $1) |
| GHK-Cu | 50mg, 100mg | TBD |
| Wolverine | 5mg, 10mg | **$199** |
| CL-1S | 10mg, 20mg, 30mg | **$159** |
| CL-2T | 10mg, 20mg, 30mg | **$159** |
| CL-3R | 10mg, 20mg, 30mg | **$179** |
| Ipamorelin | 5mg, 10mg | **$35** |
| Tesamorelin | 10mg, 20mg | **$179** |
| MOTS-c | 10mg, 40mg | TBD (placeholder $3) |
| SS-31 | 10mg, 50mg | **$129** |
| GLOW | 70mg | TBD (placeholder $1) |
| KLOW | 80mg | TBD (placeholder $1) |
| Melanotan 2 | 10mg | TBD |
| Bac Water | 3mL, 10mL | **$10** |

> **Note:** Several SKUs still carry placeholder pricing from the seed data. Final pricing to be set by CEO before launch based on COGS + margin targets. The v2 pricing philosophy (premium index, round-to-9, no discounting) remains directionally correct.

### 5.2 Pricing principles (carried from v2)

- Premium index over seed/competitor pricing. Trust-shopping audience, not price-shopping.
- Round to last-digit-9 when final prices are set.
- No discounting in the first 90 days.
- CL-3R carries a premium over CL-1S and CL-2T (triple agonist = most-scrutinized, highest COA cost).

## 6. Storefront IA — what CTO ships

```
Home shelf (above the fold, "Pathways" view):
  Recovery       → BPC-157, TB-500, GHK-Cu, Wolverine
  Weight Mgmt    → CL-1S, CL-2T, CL-3R
  Growth & Aging → Ipamorelin, Tesamorelin
  Longevity      → MOTS-c, SS-31
  Cosmetic       → GLOW, KLOW, Melanotan 2
  Supplies       → Bac Water

Nav order:
  Recovery → Weight Management → Growth & Anti-Aging → Longevity → Cosmetic → Supplies
```

The storefront uses Medusa product categories with a hierarchical structure. Products are assigned to categories via the admin API and rendered dynamically by the `categorized-products.tsx` template.
