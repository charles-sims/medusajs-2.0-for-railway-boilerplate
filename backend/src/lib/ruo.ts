/**
 * Research-Use-Only (RUO) compliance copy — backend mirror.
 *
 * Mirrors `storefront/src/lib/ruo.ts`. Backend and storefront are separate
 * apps with no shared workspace, so the canonical strings are duplicated
 * here for use in transactional emails and (eventually) the cart-completed
 * subscriber that validates attestation metadata.
 *
 * If you change copy here, update `storefront/src/lib/ruo.ts` to match —
 * and bump RUO_ATTESTATION_VERSION / RETA_ATTESTATION_VERSION when
 * attestation language changes so audit trails stay correct.
